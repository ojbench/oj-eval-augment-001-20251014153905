# Solution Summary for Problem 001 - A+B Problem

## Problem Analysis
- **Problem ID**: 1000 (ACMOJ)
- **Problem Type**: Basic arithmetic - sum of two integers
- **Input**: Two integers A and B separated by a space
- **Output**: A single number representing A + B

## Solution Approach
The solution is straightforward:
1. Read two integers from standard input
2. Calculate their sum
3. Output the result

## Implementation Details
- **Language**: C++
